                <p>
                    This project was developed as part of the group assignment for
                    <strong>WEB API DEVELOPMENT (SWC3633/SWC4443)</strong>.
                    The NASA Explorer application integrates several NASA Open APIs to make space data
                    accessible, engaging, and educational. It allows users to view the Astronomy Picture of the Day,
                    explore authentic images from Mars rovers, monitor asteroid activity through the NeoWs service,
                    and access satellite imagery of Earth via the EPIC API.
                </p>

                <div id="longBackground" class="collapse">
                    <p>
                        The NASA Explorer web app lets people navigate through contemporary and previously collected space data,
                        making the space program captivating and educational. Aim of this project is to make it easier for people
                        to learn about astronomy by presenting NASA's open datasets in a categorized, easy-to-use interface.
                        The app changes obscure raw data into useful content that is simple to explore and understand what we so users
                        don't have to search via scientific databases on their own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To this end, the app integrates various endpoints of the official NASA Open APIs, which are reliable and
                        precise sources of data. The Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API is used for showing NASA's astronomy picture
                        of the day and its name, date, and description so that the users can inform themselves about space phenomena
                        in a clear visual way. The Mars Rover Photos API provides users with the ability to browse authentic photos captured
                        by the Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers using filters to restrict sol (Martian day) values to within valid ranges.
                        Results are shown in carousel view, which leads to more effortless navigation compared to showing all images in a long scroll.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Asteroids NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) API powers the asteroid dashboard by querying JSON data sets of
                        near-Earth objects and graphing them down into smaller charts. This allows users to quickly notice the frequency of
                        asteroids heading towards Earth over a given time span. The EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) API also provides
                        recent satellite imagery of Earth from the DSCOVR satellite. As this API is usually down, the application has the caching
                        mechanism that stores the last successful dataset and displays that as a fallback so that users have the consistent
                        experience even in case of downtime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project also emphasizes safe API use by securely storing the NASA API key in configuration through User Secrets for
                        development and environment variables for production. This prevents hardcoding sensitive credentials in source code
                        with flexibility across environments. In addition, error handling and empty states are also added throughout the app.
                        When an API call is unsuccessful, or the user-provided values are outside of valid ranges, descriptive feedback messages
                        are returned by the system rather than blank or crashed pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By integrating all these different NASA endpoints on one platform, the app offers a complete space exploration portal.
                        Users can view astronomy images, discover Mars through rover imagery, monitor asteroid activity in Earth's vicinity,
                        and observe satellite images of the planet. Overall, these features offer an entertaining and informative experience
                        that generates curiosity and further interest in astronomy while ensuring the data provided is authentic and scientifically valid.
